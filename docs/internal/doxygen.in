# Doxyfile 1.10.0

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]



# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# https://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
